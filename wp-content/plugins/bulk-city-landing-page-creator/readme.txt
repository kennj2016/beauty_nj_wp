Create Multiple Geographically Targeted Landing Pages Quickly Using Generic Text & Automatically Inserted City Names.

== Description ==

This plugin creates Multiple Wordpress Pages with the provided city name in the title and body copy. Allows for parent pages, page template, page titles and contents. 
The total number of pages created will be the number of lines entered with the combination of city and state in city name, state (e.g Athens,GA) format.

= SEO Tips =
We recommend creating city-targeted pages in bulk, then customizing the content for each page. Ideally, more than half of the content on a city landing page should be unique to that page and over 500 words in length. 

When the Bulk City Landing Page Creator plugin creates a page, it will add a Custom Field for the city name. You can use Page Templates to automate the customization process by adding Google Maps, Weather and other localization to a page.

Be sure to include an Opt-In form to capture user information.
